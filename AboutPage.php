            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <br>Welcome to Chief of Beef, we are an amazing restaurant and have been serving customers ever since this assignment was forced onto us.
            <br>Our food is so mouth-wateringly beautiful that just viewing our <a href="Menu.php">menu</a>  will make you a permanant customer.
            <br>As the name of our restaurant states, we are "The Chiefs of Beef". We have a plaque that says so, can't argue with that.
            <br>We also have many options for those of you who aren't ready to fall in love with our beef dishes, take a look at our <a href="Menu.php">Menu</a>, if you dare.
